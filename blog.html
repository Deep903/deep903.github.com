                <p class="lead">The reference used in this project<a id='blog_ref' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpupXhZ92c8&list=PLy0R06Fv9ZSIHjFje2d53WztJeNjHW0zT" class="btn btn-primary">Is located here!</a></p>
                <p class='lead'>Contribution over this reference involves implementing file saving to safe the IDF-TF values so that they do not need to be calculated every time the program runs. This improves the programs efficiently greatly!</p>

                <h1>Challenge</h1>
                <p class='lead'>I had a few big challenges while creating this project. For example, deployment to the web, using python for the first time, and even file reading. My biggest problem however, was using Flask for the first time. To solve this issue, I extensively read the documentation on Flask along with various answers on sites like stack overflow. Input and output in flask was particularly hard for my to figure out until I read up enough information online. It does not work the same way as It does in javascript.</p>

                <h1>Algorithms (Basics)</h1>
                <p class='lead'>First term frequency (count of terms in a document) is calculated. Then the inverse document frequency (which is a number that represents how much a term is valued at) is calculated. Lastly, the two values are multiplied to give the TF-IDF values of every word in a document. When given a query, words in the query can be searched for in every document. When found, its TF-IDF score is added up. The documents with the highest summations are the relevant ones.</p>
